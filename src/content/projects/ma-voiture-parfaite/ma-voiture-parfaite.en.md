### At a glance

- Modular pages (blocks) editable without a developer
- Powerful, friendly blog and a reliable contact form
- Fast, SEO‑ready, and delightful on mobile and desktop

### The need

MaVoitureParfaite needed a clear and living website: present the offer, publish useful articles, and turn visitors into leads—without relying on a developer for every update.

### Our approach

We aligned on the core messages and user journeys, then built a modern, reliable foundation: pages assembled from reusable “blocks” (Hero, Benefits, Offers, Comparison, FAQ, Contact, Blog), an easy‑to‑browse blog, and a CMS‑driven contact form. The team can now publish and reorganise content autonomously while keeping a smooth, consistent experience.

### What changes for users

The value proposition is understood in seconds. Reading is comfortable, navigation is obvious, and the blog is easy to explore (search, filters, sorting). On mobile, everything remains simple and efficient.

### Tech in brief (for the curious)

Headless architecture: frontend and CMS are decoupled (Next.js × Strapi) for performance, security and evolution. Dynamic blocks: each CMS “block” maps to a frontend component you can assemble freely. Secure proxy: sensitive requests go through the server (keys protected), handy for blog search and the form. Preview: review drafts before publishing.

### What’s next

Keep publishing (case studies, practical advice), enrich the Offers page, and track conversions to continually optimise what matters.
