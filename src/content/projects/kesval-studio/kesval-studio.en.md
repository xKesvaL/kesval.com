### The need

Our website had to do what we promise to our clients: inspire trust, explain the value simply, and guide people to get in touch without friction. No jargon, no fluff. Just a pleasant, effective experience that reflects our standards.

### Our approach

We started by aligning on the essentials: what we do, for whom, and why it matters. Once the message was clear, we designed an interface that reassures at first glance: meaningful headings, comfortable reading, visible calls‑to‑action, and lightweight visuals that support the story.

On the build, we favored simplicity and performance. A handful of essential pages that load quickly, sound SEO foundations, accessibility in mind, and straightforward cookie handling. The goal: simple, reliable and enjoyable—both for visitors and for us when we update the site.

### What changes for users

On arrival, the offer is understood in seconds. Navigation feels natural, projects are easy to browse, and the path to contact is obvious. The site works just as well on mobile as it does on desktop, and switches between English and French seamlessly.

### Results

Launch was smooth, and updates are even smoother: adding a case study, a post, or a section takes minutes. Feedback has been consistent: clearer messaging, greater trust, and more direct paths to contact. It’s a solid base for growing our SEO and publishing regularly.

### Scope

Pages: Home, Services, Projects (list + detail), Blog (ready), Legal, Terms. Components: project cards, mobile/desktop navigation, CTAs, forms.

### What’s next

We’re enriching the blog (case studies, practical advice), detailing service pages further, and strengthening conversion tracking to keep improving what matters: real results.
