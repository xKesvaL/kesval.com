## Why request a (free) audit?

If your site is slow, generates few calls, or doesn’t show up locally, it’s not necessarily a “marketing problem”. Often, it’s about the basics: message clarity, performance, SEO, and the user path.

A free audit gives you an honest view and a prioritized action plan. **<u>Straightforward, no commitment</u>**.

- You know where to act first (impact > effort).
- You leave with simple improvements you can apply right away.
- You decide what’s next: do it in‑house, with us, or later.

**_Note: free audits are limited each month to keep a high level of value._**

## What we check

- Perceived speed
  - Pages that open fast on mobile. Fewer drop‑offs, more calls.
  - Goal: keep visitors and improve comfort.

- Online visibility
  - Be found by your customers (especially locally) on searches that matter.
  - Goal: more useful visits, not just “a good score”.

- Message clarity
  - In 3 seconds: who you help, the outcome, and how to contact you.
  - Goal: make people want to choose you.

- Conversion
  - A simple path to contact: short form, call button, WhatsApp.
  - Goal: turn visits into enquiries.

- Technical peace of mind
  - An up‑to‑date, backed‑up site to avoid costly outages.
  - Goal: fewer risks and more peace of mind.

## What makes our audit different

- Clear prioritization (A/B/C: A = do first) based on expected impact and effort.
- Short summary video (5 min) or a quick meeting to show exactly what to change.
- 2–3 simple improvements explained step‑by‑step so you can start right away.
- Bonus: free quote for the next steps.

**_Goal: help you improve your site as soon as possible._**

## How it works

1. Send us your URL and goals (2 minutes).
2. We test and review your site with our expertise.
3. You get a clear plan: A/B/C priorities, simple actions to start with, and order of execution + short video.
4. You choose what’s next: get a free quote from us, or apply it yourself.

## Why it’s free (and limited)

It’s our best way to show our approach: pragmatic, results‑oriented, easy for you.  
Yes, the goal is also to build trusted relationships. But it’s your decision: apply it yourself, hire us, or come back later.

**_Transparency: we accept a limited number of audits per month to keep service quality high._**

## Quick FAQ

- How long does it take?  
  48–72h after your request (excluding weekends/public holidays).

- Does it commit me to anything?  
  No. You’re free to apply it in‑house. If you want us to handle it, we’ll propose a simple plan.

- What if I don’t have all the access?  
  For the initial audit, your URL is enough. We’ll tell you if access is helpful to go further.

- What happens after the audit?  
  We can provide a free quote for the next steps, or you can apply it yourself.
