## üëã Welcome to the KesvaL Studio blog!

Hello and welcome! I am **so** glad you're here and I can't wait to write about our news, insights and our journey. My goal is to connect with you, our community, and share our <Sparkles size={10}>experience</Sparkles> with you.

## A Little Bit About Me

  <TeamProfileCard member={team.jordan} />
</div>

My name is **Jordan**, and I am the founder of KesvaL Studio. I have been in the development world for over 10 years (started at 8!) and I've worked on a variety of projects. I have a passion for technology, but when I'm not working, I spend my time at the gym, since I am a powerlifting amateur. Helps me stay focused and energized!

## Your partner in digital innovation

At KesvaL Studio, our mission is twofold:

1. **To make web and mobile development better for you**: We believe that money is not the only driver of success, we want to build long-lasting relationships with our clients, and give them the best possible experience.
2. **To collaborate with agencies as a reliable partner**: We understand that agencies often need to outsource development work, and we want to help deliver high-quality work that meets their standards.

## What we do
