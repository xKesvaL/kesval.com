## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the KesvaL Studio blog!

Hello and welcome! I am **so** glad you're here and I can't wait to write about our news, insights and our journey. My goal is to connect with you, our community, and share our <Sparkles size={10}>experience</Sparkles> with you.

I've learned that the best way to build a successful business is to surround myself with talented people and listen to their ideas. But I've also learned that I need to work with people I trust, deeply.
That is why KesvaL Studio has only two people at its core: me and my talented designer friend, [@thibaud](#). (sorry no link for now!) This is what makes KesvaL Studio unique.

> It's not just about having a team, it's about assembling the perfect team where each person brings its own expertise. Our flexible approach means your project gets exactly the expertise it needs.

## So, why is this "we" thing so important?

### 1. Smarter decisions & better results

<Tabbed>
Have you ever worked so hard on a project, be so proud of it, only to have it be heavily criticized by others? That's exactly what we are trying to avoid when delivering your project. 
</Tabbed>

<Tabbed>
Having multiple people working on a project means that we can bring different perspectives to the table. Altough it might slow down the process, we believe that higher quality beats 3 days quicker delivery.
</Tabbed>

### 2. Flexibility for your project

<Tabbed>
We know that your project is important to you, and you will most likely need to change some things. Working as a team also means we're agile, and we can adapt to your needs. For you, this means that we can apply changes to the project even when it's in progress.
</Tabbed>

### 3. It's way more fun!

<Tabbed>
Yes, we want to have fun while working on your project! This is the best way for us to be creative, get attached to your project, and deliver the best possible results.
</Tabbed>

At KesvaL Studio, "teamwork" and "agile" arenÂ´t keywords that we use to get valued by you. They are the way we work, and the way we believe in building successful projects.
