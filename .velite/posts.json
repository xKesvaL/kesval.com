I am <strong>so</strong> glad you're here and I can't wait to write about our news, insights and our journey. My goal is to connect with you, our community, and share our <sparkles size=\"{10}\">experience</sparkles> with you.</p>\n<p>I've learned that the best way to build a successful business is to surround myself with talented people and listen to their ideas. But I've also learned that I need to work with people I trust, deeply.\nThat is why KesvaL Studio has only two people at its core: me and my talented designer friend, <a href=\"#\">@thibaud</a>. (sorry no link for now!) This is what makes KesvaL Studio unique.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's not just about having a team, it's about assembling the perfect team where each person brings its own expertise. Our flexible approach means your project gets exactly the expertise it needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>So, why is this \"we\" thing so important?</h2>\n<h3>1. Smarter decisions &#x26; better results</h3>\n<tabbed>\nHave you ever worked so hard on a project, be so proud of it, only to have it be heavily criticized by others? That's exactly what we are trying to avoid when delivering your project. \n</tabbed>\n<tabbed>\nHaving multiple people working on a project means that we can bring different perspectives to the table. Altough it might slow down the process, we believe that higher quality beats 3 days quicker delivery.\n</tabbed>\n<h3>2. Flexibility for your project</h3>\n<tabbed>\nWe know that your project is important to you, and you will most likely need to change some things. Working as a team also means we're agile, and we can adapt to your needs. For you, this means that we can apply changes to the project even when it's in progress.\n</tabbed>\n<h3>3. It's way more fun!</h3>\n<tabbed>\nYes, we want to have fun while working on your project! This is the best way for us to be creative, get attached to your project, and deliver the best possible results.\n</tabbed>\n<p>At KesvaL Studio, \"teamwork\" and \"agile\" arenÂ´t keywords that we use to get valued by you. They are the way we work, and the way we believe in building successful projects.</p>\n<h2>Ready to see what our approach can do for you?</h2>\n<p>&#x3C;Button href={localizeHref(\"/contact\")}>\nLet's talk about your project\n</p>",
